The underlying principle of the environment in escaping the room with levers is based on the specific order and color of the levers that need to be pulled to open the door. The most important aspect of the environment is paying attention to both the color and order of the levers, as they hold the key to successfully escaping the room within the step limit. By carefully observing the colors of the levers and experimenting with different lever sequences, new solutions can be discovered to unlock the door and avoid being trapped. Understanding the significance of lever colors and the specific order in which they should be pulled is crucial for achieving a successful escape.Continuously strategizing and planning the lever pulling sequence based on their colors and positions is essential for finding multiple successful escape paths and ultimately opening the door within the step limit.
