The underlying principle of the environment is the specific combination of lever colors and positions that need to be manipulated in the correct sequence to successfully escape the room within the step limit. The most important aspect of the environment that the actioner should pay attention to is the relationship between the color and position of the levers, as well as the door, in order to determine the optimal pulling sequence for opening the door and escaping. By carefully analyzing the lever colors and positions, the actioner can strategically plan multiple escape routes and increase the chances of successfully completing the escape task within the step limit.
