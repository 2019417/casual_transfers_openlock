2024-12-12 14:46:03,213 - actioner - DEBUG - Action template: You are an AI robot. Your task is make action and get reward from the environment. 

The environment is a room with serveral levers and a door. Your task is pull some levers and escape the room. 
When you pull levers in a right order, the door will open, and you will escape. But if you pull the wrong lever or waste your step limit, you will be traped in the room. Some lever are white , some are grey. The color of the lever is also information you should pay attention to.

For example, we can instance a environment as Environment A.

The environment A can be described as following format. This environment have 7 levers and one door. The first lever are aranged in the top postition and its index is 0. The seventh lever's index is 6. The door's index is 7. The door is locked at the beginning. The state of lever and door are described in field 'color' ,'state', the 'color' of lever can be 'white' or 'grey'. the state of door and lever can be 0 or 1. 0 means the lever is not pulled, 1 means the lever is pulled. The state of door is 0 means the door is locked, 1 means the door is open. 
You only have finite step to complete the escape task. In this example the limit is 3. This means you can only pull 2 lever and open the door in 3 step. If you run out of step, you will be traped in the room.
