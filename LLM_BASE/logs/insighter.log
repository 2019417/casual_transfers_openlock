2024-12-12 14:46:01,448 - insighter - DEBUG - Insight template: Your task analyse the history and environment and combine the knowlegde to give insight and advice help other complete their tasks and get more helpful information about their action and environment

Bacically, your task is:

1. analyse the knowlegde provided to you and make connection to the history and environment.
for example:
what aspect of the history and environment is related to the knowlegde? what's the relationship between the knowlegde and the history and environment?

2. use your thinking and understanding about knowlegde to analyse the casual relationship behind the history and environment.
for example:
why some case in the history is successful and some is not? what action make the case successful? what action make the case fail? What relationship between the action and environment' response have? what's is underlying mechanism behind the relationship? And how to use it?

3. Based on your think and analyse, You should get some insight about the history and environment, and give advice to help other complete their tasks and offer helpful information about their action and environment. Your insight should contain the following information:

- what's the insight you get? 
- What action you think should take next time?
- why you think the action is helpful?
- relationship between the action and environment' response

Now, It's time for you to complete the task.

The environment information is:

The environment is a room with serveral levers and a door. Your task is pull some levers and escape the room. 
When you pull levers in a right order, the door will open, and you will escape. But if you pull the wrong lever or waste your step limit, you will be traped in the room. Some lever are white , some are grey. The color of the lever is also information you should pay attention to.

For example, we can instance a environment as Environment A.

The environment A can be described as following format. This environment have 7 levers and one door. The first lever are aranged in the top postition and its index is 0. The seventh lever's index is 6. The door's index is 7. The door is locked at the beginning. The state of lever and door are described in field 'color' ,'state', the 'color' of lever can be 'white' or 'grey'. the state of door and lever can be 0 or 1. 0 means the lever is not pulled, 1 means the lever is pulled. The state of door is 0 means the door is locked, 1 means the door is open. 
You only have finite step to complete the escape task. In this example the limit is 3. This means you can only pull 2 lever and open the door in 3 step. If you run out of step, you will be traped in the room.

the number of solutions can be more one. You should to find new solutions instead of the known solutions.

There are:

2. Pull the third lever, pull the second lever, open the door. means (2, 1, 7)

But the environment can be set or reset, so the solution can be different. You need to find new solutions instead of the known solutions and adopt to new environment. Some mechanism and principle are same in different environment. You should find the mechanism and principle and use them to find new solutions.

The environment information is:

The environment is a room with serveral levers and a door. Your task is pull some levers and escape the room. 
When you pull levers in a right order, the door will open, and you will escape. But if you pull the wrong lever or waste your step limit, you will be traped in the room. Some lever are white , some are grey. The color of the lever is also information you should pay attention to.

For example, we can instance a environment as Environment A.

The environment A can be described as following format. This environment have 7 levers and one door. The first lever are aranged in the top postition and its index is 0. The seventh lever's index is 6. The door's index is 7. The door is locked at the beginning. The state of lever and door are described in field 'color' ,'state', the 'color' of lever can be 'white' or 'grey'. the state of door and lever can be 0 or 1. 0 means the lever is not pulled, 1 means the lever is pulled. The state of door is 0 means the door is locked, 1 means the door is open. 
You only have finite step to complete the escape task. In this example the limit is 3. This means you can only pull 2 lever and open the door in 3 step. If you run out of step, you will be traped in the room.

    {
        'color': 'white',

    {
        'door': np.int64(0), 
        'state': np.int64(0)
    }
]

the step limit is 3
The solutions of the environment A are:
[
    # the first solution
    [
        {
            'step': 1, 
            'action': 2 # first pull the third lever
        }, 
        {
            'step': 2, 
            'action': 5 # the pull the sixth lever
        }, 
        {
            'step': 3, 
            'action': 7 # then open the door
        }
    ], 
    # the second solution
    [
        {
            'step': 1, 
            'action': 2 # first pull the third lever
        },
        {
            'step': 1, 
            'action': 1 # first pull the second lever
        },
        {
            'step': 7,
            'action': 7 # then open the door
        }
    ]
    # maybe more solutions
]

the number of solutions can be more one. You should to find new solutions instead of the known solutions.
Now we can see the environment A at least have 2 solutions
There are:

1. Pull the third lever, pull the sixth lever, open the door. means (2, 5, 7)
2. Pull the third lever, pull the second lever, open the door. means (2, 1, 7)

But the environment can be set or reset, so the solution can be different. You need to find new solutions instead of the known solutions and adopt to new environment. Some mechanism and principle are same in different environment. You should find the mechanism and principle and use them to find new solutions.

The knowlegde is:

- The color of the levers indicates their grouping, with white levers and grey levers forming separate groups. We should choose levers from the same color group.

- The correct order to follow in order to get the most reward is to always choose levers that have a common child. This pattern has been consistently successful in finding the solution.

Now give your insight and advice. Think slowly. Think deeply. And give the best insight you have.
your repsone is according following format.

- which color should actioner choose? one sentence, Be neat and clear. 
- which order shoudl actioner follow? common parent or commom child. one sentence, Be neat and clear.

each point contain 1 sentence. No need to write too much. 



2024-12-12 14:48:32,037 - insighter - DEBUG - Insight: - The actioner should choose levers from the same color group, either white or grey.
- The actioner should follow the common child order to maximize the chances of finding the solution.
